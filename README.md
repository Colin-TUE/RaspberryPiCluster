# RaspberryPiCluster

Repo containing the resources, links, and other stuff I used to setup my own K8s Cluster using Raspberry Pis

## Materials

The materials I used for this cluster are:

- 1x Raspberry Pi 3 Model B v1.2 2015 for the control node.
- 3x Raspberry Pi 3 Model B v1.2 2015 for the compute nodes.
- 1x Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ 2017 for a compute node with different specs.
- 1x ... managed switch/router for the networking. (TBD)
- 5x 32 GB MicroSD cards (one per Raspberry Pi)
  - recommended minimum is 8 GB
  - Raspberry Pi model 3B maximum is 32 GB
- ...
- a bunch of Micro USB cables and adapters for power routing.
  - or use 1 power adapter with many USB ports (preferable)
- a bunch of network cables (CAT5E) for network connectivity.
